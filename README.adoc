= XYZ Reader

The XYZ Reader is an Android application created as part of
Material Design for Android Developers course.

The initial code is based on a starter code: https://github.com/udacity/xyz-reader-starter-code.

The XYZ Reader application is a mock RSS feed reader featuring
banner photos and headlines.

The main goals of this project are:

- Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
- Apply Material Design guidelines to a mobile application.
- Separate an interface into surfaces.
- Effectively use transitions and motion.

== Screenshots

The application provides a list of articles. Once the article is selected,
the application displays the article. The navigation between the screens
is performed with transitions.
